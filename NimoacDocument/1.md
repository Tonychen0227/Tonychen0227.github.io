## Prologue: The Debate on Tempo and Value

This guide originated from a sudden inspiration during heated debates between myself and a good friend (alphabooo) regarding the value models of Ark Nova. Although Ark Nova features many diverse gameplay elements, its overall value model remains unified and cohesive. From there, I took on the endeavor of using a document to closely analyze the value of each and every element in Ark Nova.

Ark Nova is a meticulously designed Eurogame, where players assume the roles of managers striving to build the most influential and modern-managed zoo. Players may house animals in their zoo to admire, earning appeal. Players may also dispatch association workers to collaborate with other zoos (partner zoos), conduct research (university), or to execute conservation projects, earning conservation points. Players strategically allocate resources to manage their zoos, with the highest-scoring player emerging victorious.

Two parameters contribute to a player's score: appeal and conservation points. Two other non-scoring, but extremely crucial parameters are reputation and money. Building enclosures and playing animals require spending money, while reputation grants special rewards based on level as well as allowing the player to access more cards as the level increases!

In addition, all animals exist as cards, alongside sponsors and conservation projects. They provide the fundamental building blocks for building the highest scoring zoo.
